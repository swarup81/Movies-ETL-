# Movies-ETL-
# purpose

The project aims at creating an ETL pipeline that takes raw data and transforms and loads the data into existing tables. 
In This project, 
the first step is to extract data from Wikipedia data stored in JSON and Kaggle data stored in CSV. From Kaggle data, we have used movies_metadata.csv and ratings.csv files. 
The second step is to transform, which includes cleaning Wikipedia and kaggle data. Once the data is cleaned, merge Wikipedia and kaggle datasets into one dataset.
The last step is to load the new dataset and ratings dataset to the SQL database.
